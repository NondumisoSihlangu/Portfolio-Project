Housing Dataset Cleaning Project
Overview
This project aims to clean and prepare a housing dataset for further analysis. The dataset contains information about various attributes of houses such as price, owner, size, location, and other relevant features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx. It contains 56 478 rows and 19 columns. Each row represents a single house entry, and each column represents a different attribute of the houses.

Cleaning Process
The data cleaning process involves several steps to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis. These steps include:

Standardizing Formats: Standardize formats for categorical variables and ensure consistency in data representation.

Handling Missing Values: Identify and address missing values in the dataset. This may involve imputation or removal of rows/columns with excessive missing values.

Removing Duplicates: Check for and remove duplicate entries in the dataset.

Data Transformation: Perform transformations such as normalization or scaling to prepare the data for modeling.

Data Validation: Validate the cleaned dataset to ensure it meets the quality standards required for analysis.

Tools Used:
SQL Server 

To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
